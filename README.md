A helper bot for web-platform-tests.

Authoring tests
=====

For the purposes of automated testing, this project uses [the `replay`
module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/replay) to record responses from the
GitHub HTTP API. Contributors seeking to add new tests or modify existing tests
will need to capture new request/response pairs. This can be achieved as
follows:

1. Create a "personal access token" though GitHub.com (no particular access
   scopes are necessary)
2. Set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to the value created above, set
   the `REPLAY` environment variable to `record`, and run the tests.
3. If the tests pass, include the files that were generated by the previous
   command in the patch.
